# Pixelator App

<p>The original app was an extension of my Code in Place final 2021 final project. I was able to finish the app for the course and then added a GUI and other enhancements afterwards.  My new goal is to rewrite the app using rust instead of python.  I'm not sure there is enough capability to implement a GUI so for now this will be a command line program.  
</p>

My next steps are to implement the following:

* [ ] Convert pixelation program from python to rust
    * [ ] Load image to pixelate (either within program or via command line)
    * [ ] Let user choose palettes for pixelation
        * [ ] Some way to view palettes to make choice
    * [ ] Write functions to implement image pixelation
        * [ ] Call functions upon image
    * [ ] Some way to show/load image for user
    * [ ] Ability to save pixelated image to disk
